- [x] demo model
- [x] inference code
- [ ] training code




## Acknowledgements

For the demo, GPUs are supported from [zerogpu](https://huggingface.co/zero-gpu-explorers), and auto masking generation codes are based on [OOTDiffusion](https://github.com/levihsu/OOTDiffusion) and [DCI-VTON](https://github.com/bcmi/DCI-VTON-Virtual-Try-On).  
Parts of the code are based on [IP-Adapter](https://github.com/tencent-ailab/IP-Adapter).
